<h1><a name="OLE_LINK2"></a><a name="OLE_LINK1">Persistence Architectural Overview</a></h1>

<p>The persistence layer is responsible for storing and
retrieving objects in the Windchill Method Server to and from a persistent
datastore such as a database.</p>

<p>The architecture is implemented using several packages.  The
<a href="../../../wnc/CommonCore/wt/dataservice/package-summary.html">dataservice</a>
package provides the abstraction for a datastore.  For example, the unique
implementation differences between Oracle and SQLServer are encapsulated in the
classes, <a href="../../../wnc/CommonCore/wt/dataservice/Oracle.html">wt.dataservice.Oracle</a>
and <a href="../../../wnc/CommonCore/wt/dataservice/SQLServer.html">wt.dataservice.SQLServer</a>,
respectively.  The main supported APIs for accessing persistence operations are
defined and implemented in the <a href="../wt/fc/package-summary.html">fc</a>
package.  To formulate queries to retrieve persistent data, the <a
href="../wt/query/package-summary.html">query</a> package is used to build
query specifications for modeled classes and attributes and the <a
href="../com/ptc/core/query/common/package-summary.html">type query</a> package
is used to build query specifications for types and global/standard attributes.</p>

<h2>Object Relational Mapping</h2>

<p>The persistence layer implements an object to relational
mapping based on Java annotations that are specified directly in the source code.  These
annotations are used at compile time to generate serialized
introspection information files that can be accessed via introspection APIs.  A
Data Definition Language (DDL) creation tool is used for generating DDL scripts
that create the tables, index, and other schema objects that must exist in the
relational database.  The DDL scripts must be run prior to the application
server start up (usually at install time).  The same introspection files and
APIs are used at application server runtime to generate Data Manipulation
Language (DML) that is executed using JDBC APIs.  The basic persistence
operations create, read, update, and delete are implemented using DML INSERT,
SELECT, UPDATE, and DELETE, respectively.</p>

<p>The mapping is based on the following rules:</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li>For an object to be persisted, its class must implement
     the <a href="../wt/fc/Persistable.html">wt.fc.Persistable</a> interface.</li>
 <li>Each class maps to its own database table</li>
 <li>Persistent attributes for simple types (e.g. String,
     Number, Timestamp) map to table columns</li>
 <li>Aggregated attributes (a 1-to-1 relationship with a class
     that implements <a href="../wt/fc/ObjectMappable.html">wt.fc.ObjectMappable</a>)
     are decomposed into their simple attributes</li>
 <li>Attributes are stored as Binary Large Objects (Blobs) when
     their type is non-simple or their cardinality is unbounded (1-to-many)</li>
 <li>Classes inherit persistent attributes from super types</li>
</ul>

<p>The following UML diagram shows an example mapping. </p>

<p>The class MyItem maps directly to the MyItem table because
it extends <a href="../wt/fc/Item.html">wt.fc.Item</a> which implements the <a
href="../wt/fc/Persistable.html">Persistable</a> interface.  The super class
attributes would include all field of <a href="../wt/fc/PersistInfo.html">wt.fc.PersistInfo</a>
since these are aggregated by <a href="../wt/fc/Persistable.html">Persistable</a>.  The
MyItem attributes a1, a2, and a3 are all mapped to columns.  The
attribute a3 is mapped to a Blob column type since it is not a simple type with
a SQL column type representation.  The work attribute is an aggregate of the
MyAddress class so the street, city, state, and zip attributes are all mapped
to individual columns.  The list attribute can contain multiple values so it is
mapped to a Blob column type also.</p>

<p>Persistent relationships can be implemented between
Persistable objects using a <a href="../wt/fc/BinaryLink.html">wt.fc.BinaryLink</a>.
A <a href="../wt/fc/BinaryLink.html">BinaryLink</a> implements
<a href="../wt/fc/Persistable.html">Persistable</a> and aggregates references to
two objects, role A and role B.  It can be used to implement relationships with
any cardinality.  The <a href="../wt/fc/ForeignKeyLink.html">wt.fc.ForeignKeyLink</a>
is a specialization of <a href="../wt/fc/BinaryLink.html">BinaryLink</a>.
This class implements the association by aggregating the role B reference in
the role A object's table.  It can only be used when the cardinality for the
role B object is zero or one.</p>

<p>Objects that are stored persistently have an identifier that
is unique within the database.  More than one copy of an object can exist in
memory and each can be manipulated independently.  Any changes to in memory
objects are only reflected in the persistent state when an insert, update or
delete is executed and the associated transaction is committed.  The
persistent attribute values are mapped to the associated database columns and
the appropriate database command is executed.  Likewise, when a query is
executed, the result column values are mapped to the attribute values in the
object.  When multiple copies of a persistent object with the same unique
identifier are updated or deleted, the persistence layer ensures that the first
operation is not overwritten by subsequent operations.  This implemented using
an update count mechanism.  For an operation to successfully complete, the in
memory object's update count must match the state in the database.  Otherwise,
a <a href="../wt/pom/ObjectIsStaleException.html">wt.pom.ObjectIsStaleException</a>
is thrown.  To avoid this type of exception, the object should be locked when
it is updated by concurrent threads or refreshed from the database when it is
updated by the same thread.</p>

<h2>Internal Architecture</h2>

<p>The main methods used to exist in the
<a href="../wt/fc/StandardPersistenceManager.html">wt.fc.StandardPersistenceManager</a>.
This is a standard Windchill service that can be accessed through the service
interface and helpers, <a href="../wt/fc/PersistenceManager.html">wt.fc.PersistenceManager</a>,
<a href="../wt/fc/PersistenceManagerSvr.html">wt.fc.PersistenceManagerSvr</a>, <a
href="../wt/fc/PersistenceHelper.html">wt.fc.PersistenceHelper</a>, and <a
href="../wt/fc/PersistenceServerHelper.html">wt.fc.PersistenceServerHelper</a>.
  The <a href="../wt/fc/StandardPersistenceManager.html">StandardPersistenceManager</a>
forwards calls to the <a href="../wt/pom/package-summary.html">pom</a> layer
and specifically to the <a href="../wt/pom/PersistentObjectManager.html">wt.pom.PersistentObjectManager</a>.
  The <a href="../wt/pom/package-summary.html">pom</a> layer is also responsible
for handling database connections and transactions.  Database connections are
implicitly obtained as needed when processing operations.  The <a
href="../wt/pom/POMHandler.html">wt.pom.POMHandler</a> implements a connection
pool to balance database connection resources with multiple, concurrent requests.</p>

<p>Database transactions are implemented via <a href="../wt/pom/Transaction.html">wt.pom.Transaction</a>.
  A transaction enables multiple operations to be committed as a single unit of work.  The
<a href="../wt/pom/Transaction.html">Transaction</a> object is designed to be used
in Java try/finally blocks and supports logical nesting.  Each local <a
href="../wt/pom/Transaction.html">Transaction</a> can be committed or rolled
back.  If a rollback method is called, the database rollback occurs
immediately.  If a commit method is called, the actual database commit will
only occur for the method call on the outer most nested <a href="../wt/pom/Transaction.html">Transaction</a>
 object.  The persistence layer uses a read-committed transaction isolation level.  This means that
concurrent operations uncommitted updates in one transaction are not seen by
other transactions until a commit occurs.  Blocking only occurs when two
concurrent operations attempt to update, delete, or lock the same object.</p>

<p>The <a href="../wt/pom/PersistentObjectManager.html">PersistentObjectManager</a>
forwards calls to the <a href="../wt/pds/package-summary.html">pds</a> layer
and specifically to a class that implements the <a href="../wt/pds/PDSIfc.html">wt.pds.PDSIfc</a>
instance.  Generally, there is a <a href="../wt/pds/PDSIfc.html">PDSIfc</a>
implementation for each support database.  The <a href="../wt/pds/package-summary.html">pds</a>
layer is also responsible for generating DML SQL statements, executing the statements, and returning
results.  Part of these responsibilities also includes the mapping of the
object attributes to SQL data and SQL results to object attributes.  The SQL
statements are executed using standard Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) APIs.
