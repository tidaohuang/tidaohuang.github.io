<h1>Configuration File Directory</h1>
<p>
All configuration files are accessed at runtime in a single directory specified
by the property, <code>com.ptc.windchill.enterprise.queryBuilder.documenationDirectoryPath</code>.
The default directory path is <code>$(wt.home)/conf/reportTemplate</code>.  Each
file in this directory that has a name ending with ".qbDoc.xml" will be considered an
XML configuration file.
</p>
<p>
Configuration files can be customized.  The customized configuration file will only need to be added
to the configuration file directory.  It is recommended to use standard "safe area" for managing
customized files.  See the "Managing Customizations" section of the Windchill Customizer's Guide for
more information.
</p>
<h1>Configuration File XML Schema</h1>
<p>
A Query Builder documentation XML configuration file uses the following schema.
</p>
<BR>
<code>
&lt;!ELEMENT documentation ((description?,documentationUrl?,entry+)+)&gt;
<BR>
<BR>
&lt;!ATTLIST entry locale CDATA #IMPLIED&gt;
<BR>
&lt;!ELEMENT entry (description?,documentationUrl?)&gt;
<BR>
&lt;!ATTLIST entry className CDATA #REQUIRED&gt;
<BR>
&lt;!ATTLIST entry locale CDATA #IMPLIED&gt;
<BR>
&lt;!ATTLIST entry prefix (true|false) false&gt;
<BR>
<BR>
&lt;!ELEMENT description (#PCDATA?)&gt;
<BR>
&lt;!ATTLIST description resourceBundle CDATA #IMPLIED&gt;
<BR>
&lt;!ATTLIST description resourceKey CDATA #IMPLIED&gt;
<BR>
&lt;!ATTLIST description useJavadoc (true|false) false&gt;
<BR>
<BR>
&lt;!ELEMENT documentationUrl (#PCDATA?)&gt;
<BR>
&lt;!ATTLIST documentationUrl codebaseRelative (true|false) false&gt;
<BR>
&lt;!ATTLIST documentationUrl javadocRelative (true|false) false&gt;
<BR>
&lt;!ATTLIST documentationUrl useJavadoc (true|false) false&gt;
</code>
<p>
The configuration file has entry elements that specify documentation for a class or group of classes within a locale.
The <code>entry</code> element <code>className</code> attribute can specify a single class or a group of classes
that start with the <code>className</code> value if the <code>prefix</code> attribute is true.  If the <code>locale</code>
attribute is specified, then the entry specifies localized documentation and will be used when the user's locale matches
the <code>locale</code> value.  The single top level <code>documentation</code> element can specify a default 
<code>locale</code> attribute.  This default locale will apply to all entries unless it is overriden in the 
<code>entry</code> element.  If no locale is specified in both the <code>entry</code> and <code>documentation</code> 
elements, then this is a base entry which will be used when there is no match for the user's locale. 
</p>
<p>
Each entry can specify a description and documentation URL.   The <code>description</code> element can contain text.  If
it does not contain text, then it can specify external sources.  If the <code>useJavadoc</code> attribute is true, then
the description text will be parsed from the Javadoc for the class.  If the <code>resourceBundle</code> attribute is
specified, then that resource bundle will be used to look up the text decripttion.  If a resource bundle is used, then
the resource key will be the <code>className</code> value unless <code>resourceKey</code> is specified.  The
<code>documentationUrl</code> element can contain a text URL.  If the <code>javadocRelative</code> attribute is true,
then the URL text is assumed to be relative URL to the javadoc base.  If the <code>codebaseRelative</code> attribute is true,
then the URL text is assumed to be relative URL to the codebase.  If the <code>useJavadoc</code> attribute is true, then
the documenation URL will be built referencing the Javadoc for the class.
</p>
<p>
The <code>description</code> and <code>documentationUrl</code> elements can also appear as siblings to the <code>entry</code> 
elements.  When used this way, the <code>description</code> and <code>documentationUrl</code> elements are used as default
values that apply to all subsequent sibling <code>entry</code> elements.  For example, a <code>description</code> element 
could contain a <code>useJavadoc</code> attribute with a true value.  This would indicate that all subsequent entries should
have description text parsed from Javadoc.  If any of the <code>entry</code> elements had a child <code>description</code> 
element, then the child's values would override the default.
</p>

<h1>Javadoc Comments</h1>
<p>
The Query Builder documentation can also be specified directly in the Javadoc comments.  This is done via directives embedded
within HTML comments in the javadoc.  The following directives are supported.
</p>
<code>
&lt;!-- QBDOC.description --&gt;
</code>
<BR>
This directive specifies that the description text will be parsed from the Javadoc for the class.   The first paragraph of the
class Javadoc will be used as the description.
<BR>
<BR>
<code>
&lt;!-- QBDOC.descriptionBegin --&gt;
</code>
<BR>
<code>
&lt;!-- QBDOC.descriptionEnd --&gt;
</code>
<BR>
This pair of directives must be used together.  The description will contain the text between these two comments.
<BR>
<BR>
<code>
&lt;!-- QBDOC.documentationUrl </code><i>relative URL</i><code> --&gt;
</code>
<BR>
This directive specifies the documentation URL will be generated relative to the javadoc base.  If <i>relative URL</i> is not specified,
then the URL will refrence the class javadoc.

<h1>Best Practices</h1>
<p>
The following are recommended best practices for providing Query Builder documentation.   If the class is relevant to a report query, then 
a Query Builder documentation entry should be added.  In general, classes are relevant to report queries if any of the following statments
apply.
<ul>
<li>The class is marked as a Supported API.</li>
<li>The class directly correlates to some concept in the User Interface.  For example, a table in the User Interface contains data from
the attributes of a class or an association link class is navigated to provide related information.</li>
<li>The class is a supporting class needed for queries that populate data shown in the User Interface.</li>
<li>Customers have mades inquiries about the class related to building Query Builder queries.   The customer requests may have been made 
indirectly via Global Services, Product Owners, or Technical Support.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
If a class requires Query Builder documentation and it is not currently a Supported API, then consider whether this class should be 
made a Supported API.  If the Supported API is true, then the class Javadoc will be available at runtime and can be made available
to Query Builder users.   Also, determine if the existing Javadoc class and attribute information is sufficient.  Some comments may need 
to be added that provide information specific to queries.  It is recommended that required documentation should be 
added to Javadoc. 
</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
The description can be derived from the first paragraph of the class Javadoc description (assuming that Supported API is true so that the
Javadoc is available at runtime).   If the existing Javadoc has basic information on the purpose of the class, then an entry can be used 
that will derive the description from Javadoc automatically.  The <code>description</code> element <code>useJavadoc</code> attribute can
be used for this.   If the Javadoc class description that is most appropriate for Query Builder is not the first paragraph, then use
the <code>QBDOC.descriptionBegin</code> and <code>QBDOC.description</code> Javadoc comments to delimit the portion of text that should 
be used as the description.  If adding or using the Javadoc description is not possible or appropriate, then the description can be added as text.  
The recommended practice for this is to add a description to a resource bundle and use the <code>description</code> element 
<code>resourceBundle</code> attribute.
</p>
<h2>Documentation URL</h2>
<p>
This information should reference attributes on the class along with short descriptions of their meaning or purpose.   It should also 
include information on how this class is associated to other classes.   Determine if the full Javadoc for the class meets these needs.   
Other existing sources for this information may include package Javadoc, Windchill documentation or other external documentation  
(e.g. Tech Support articles).  If new documentation is added, the recommended practice is to add the document to a "doc-files" directory in 
a related package directory.  The document can then be referenced using the <code>docuentationUrl</code> element with 
<code>javadocRelative</code> attribute equal to <code>true</code>.   If a high level document is added, it is also a good practice to 
add references to individual class Javadoc which has more class specific details.

<h1>Examples</h1>
<dl>

<dt><a href="Reporting.qbDoc.html">Reporting</a></dt>
<dd>This references documentation that has been added to a "doc-files" directory.  It contains an image that shows the associations between
the key classes in the Reporting model.
</dd>
<dt><a href="https://support.ptc.com/appserver/cs/view/solution.jsp?n=CS63595">Change</a></dt>
<dd>This refernces a Technical Support article that is available to customers.  The document was written to satisfy requests for information that
could be used to build report queries. 
</dd>

<dt><a href="../../../../index.html?wt/part/WTPart.html">WTPart</a></dt>
<dd>This references the class Javadoc directly.  This can be specified by using the <code>documentationUrl</code> element <code>useJavadoc</code> 
attribute.
